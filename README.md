# Awesome AI Tools 
<!-- section: Introduction -->
<!-- Describe what this document refers to. At what target audience is it aimed? -->
A curated list of AI-powered tools. AI is a driving factor in the business context and is likely to grow in the future. We want to compile a list of tools that are useful for a business (e.g. Software Development, marketing, sales, HR, data analytics, ...). The order of topics, as well as the order of bullet points, serves no purpose and is not intended to introduce a hierarchy.

If you want to contribute to this list, send a PR! Thanks for your awesome contribution :)
