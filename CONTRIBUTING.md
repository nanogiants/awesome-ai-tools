## Contribution Guidelines

### Contributing

You can help improve this repository by making it more coherent, consistent, or readable, adding missing information, correcting factual errors, fixing typos, or bringing them up to date.

To do so, make changes to the source files (i.e. this very document & README.md). Then open a pull request to apply your changes to the master branch.

### Please ensure your Pull Request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Create a branch with yourname/feature. For example:
git checkout -b sandramsc/feature-navbar
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive of your changes.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
[Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) is a nice free tool for this and has browser extensions.
- Pull requests should have a useful title.

### Updating your Pull Request (PR):

Sometimes, it can be challenging to ensure that a PR aligns with the mentioned standards. If the maintainers identify any desired modifications, we will request you to edit your existing PR rather than opening a new one. In case you're unsure about the editing process, simply submit the PR and await approval or comments from the maintainers.
